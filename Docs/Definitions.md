5. **Group Index:**
    
    Each node offers a set of processes which are applications or router services. 
    These sets may be uniquely identified by a single number, which we call their Group Index 
    such that we may directly infer what kind of services are offered by that node in the cluster,
    and where can its dependencies be found based on _their_ service group indices.
